# Calculator Live

A simple calculator wep app that can calculate strings of operations. Accepts only 1 decimal point for now.

## Getting Started

As this is a simple web app it doesn't need any special installation. Just run the index.html file and web app will load.

### Prerequisites

Clone ths repo, https://github.com/ryecoder/calculator-live,

```
git clone https://github.com/ryecoder/calculator-live
```

### Installing

I use Visual Studio code for coding and running a live server with hot reload. But you can run the index.html file on your browser and manually reload the browser if it is more preferred. To run in Visual Studio code.

Install this plugin in Visual Studio Code
